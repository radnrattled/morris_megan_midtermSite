Peroni Nastro Azzurro made shopping history when it opened 'Emporio Peroni', a minimalist boutique. Situated on one of the world's most stylish thoroughfares, Sloane Street in London, it sat comfortably alongside other leading Italian fashion brands.<br><br>Emporio was so exclusive that only window shopping was permitted – the ultimate way to drive people’s interest and desire.</p>

		Peroni Nastro Azzurro launched iconic advertising campaigns that have been essential to the success of the brand. In these campaigns the model is styled in a sailer outfit and hat, as an homage to the sea and sailing world, a passion strongly held by the Peroni family.
<br><br>All advertising continued this nautical theme; the ribbon on the sailor hat was representative of the one featured on the neck of the bottle, becoming a hugely recognisable symbol for the brand.</p>

One of the traits of the ‘quiet’ revolution’ was an increase in consumption.<br><br>During this economic boom there was a sudden rise of people moving into urban areas. Italians wanted to be in the big cities, Rome in particular. This shift radically altered the fabric of Italian society and it was in the second half of this decade that Birra Peroni started its phenomenal growth.</p>

It was called Birra Peroni and still bears the founder’s name to this day.<br><br>It was a combination of climate, close proximity to the mountains – where ice and glacial water was plentiful - and the quality of ingredients that helped Francesco create such a distinctive pale, medium-strength beer that within a short time had become vastly popular.</p>
